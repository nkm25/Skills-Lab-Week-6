## Why we chose our License and Code of Conduct:
We chose the "Do What You Want License" because we wanted people to be able to have freedom with our (fake) open source project.
We chose Google's Code of Conduct because Google is a trustworthy company, and we thought that Google provided thorough and reasonable 
codes of conduct for their own site. We also wanted everyone to be able to have a chance to access our (fake) open source project, just as Google does.
